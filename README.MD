# MBT_Nodejs_i18n
A lightweight Nodejs i18n plug-in developed by the MBT_TLT team

# Light
- Lightweight, this plug-in only accounts for xxx kb
- supports interpolated text i18n
- You can actively reset i18n objects while the project running

# Install
```shell
npm install -s @mbt_tlt/mbt_nodejs_i18n
```

# Usage
## 0. import
You can choose to import and use MBT_Nodejs_i18n using the following methods

1.For ES6
```javascript
import i18n from '@mbt_tlt/mbt_nodejs_i18n'
```
or
```javascript
import { i18n } from '@mbt_tlt/mbt_nodejs_i18n'
```
2.For NodeJS

we're sorry, because MBT_Nodejs_i18n is developed using the ES module specification, and there is no compatibility with CommonJS for the time being,
So to use the plug-in, you need to name the JavaScript file suffix that imported the component .ejs, and then import and use it in the same way as ES6ã€‚

Or you can change your NodeJS to the ES module specification by adding the following configuration code to the package.json root node of your NodeJS project
<span style="color: red">[note: if your project was originally developed according to the CommonJS specification, this will lead to compatibility problems with your project!
]</span>
```text
"type": "module",
```

MBT_Nodejs_i18n provides two exposure methods, which are:
- `i18n` - i18n Core
- `i18nInit` - i18n Initialization function, pass in a path string that stores the i18n file of your project. If the i18n file is stored in the i18n folder under the project root directory, there is no need to call this function actively.

## 1. Initialization
MBT_Nodejs_i18n provides the i18nInit function, which is used to initialize or reset the i18n data information object for the plug-in, which is documented as:
```javascript
/**
 * i18nInit - Reinitialization is supported, the reinitialization content will overwrite the original i18nObj and i18nLanguageArr
 *
 * @export
 * @const
 * @function
 * @param { string } [i18nDirPath = path.resolve('./', 'i18n')] - i18n folder path
 * */
```
If the i18n related files of your project are stored in the i18n folder under the root of your project, there is no need to call this function actively. MBT_Nodejs_i18n has done everything for you. ðŸ˜Ž

If your i18n-related files are not stored in the i18n folder in the root directory of your project, you need to actively call the i18nInit function before using i18n and pass in the storage path of your project i18n files, like this:
```javascript
// Suppose the i18n file is stored in the path 'D://i18n'
import { i18nInit } from '@mbt_tlt/mbt_nodejs_i18n';

// you code ...
i18nInit('D://i18n');
// you code ...
```

## 2. Simple text
For simple text, you can simply give the key of the text

Suppose the i18n related files like this:
```json
{
    "test": "this is a text"
}
```
Example:
```javascript
const a = i18n('test')

// will show "this is a text" in your console
console.log(a);
```


## 3. Interpolated text
For some complex scenes that need to be interpolated in the text, you only need to give an additional replacement object replaceObj on the basis of the key of the text,
and it should be noted that a given replaceObj must contain the same replaceKey index as text interpolation

Suppose the i18n related files like this:
```json
{
    "test": "this is a ${ a }"
}
```
Example:
```javascript
const b = i18n('test', {
    a: 'text'
});

// will show "this is a text" in your console
console.log(b);
```

## 4. Specify i18n language
Sometimes, we need to specify that the text output is in an i18n language, and all we need to do is to give its language identity.

Suppose there are two i18n related files, en-US.json and zh-CN.json like this:
```json
{
    "test": "this is a ${ a }"
}
```
```json
{
    "test": "è¿™æ˜¯ä¸€æ®µ${ a }"
}
```
Example:
```javascript
const c = i18n('test', {
    a: 'æ–‡æœ¬'
}, 'zh-CN');

// will show "è¿™æ˜¯ä¸€æ®µæ–‡æœ¬" in your console
console.log(c);
```

## 5. Reset i18n object
In addition to the initialization function mentioned above, the i18nInit function provided by MBT_Nodejs_i18n can also be used to reset i18n objects at any time.

Application scenarios:
- The i18n file in your i18n folder will change while the project running
- Your i18n folder will dynamically add or delete some i18n files while the project running

After the above scenario occurs, you can actively call the i18nInit function to reset the i18n object.

<span style="color: orange">[note: calling i18nInit will re-read and parse all i18n files under the given i18n folder, which is a performance-consuming process]</span>
